# Setting some bounds

- Want to plot some continuous phenomena in space
  - probability of presence, utilization, abundance etc
- Values are important (not just "background")


---

# WE ARE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT:

- colour schemes
- projections
- whether ggplot2 is better than base graphics
- how ugly Dave's plots are in general

---

# To contour or not to contour?


---

# Are continuous legends actually useless?
